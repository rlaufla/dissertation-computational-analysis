Python script for computations analysis of Korean newspaper articles (Phd dissertation)


This repository contains all Python scripts and supporting files used in the sentiment analysis and lexical feature comparison of Korean media articles, including period-based TF-IDF and z-score heatmap visualization, as part of a PhD dissertation.

> **Note:** Initial code drafts were generated with ChatGPT (OpenAI 2025), then reviewed, modified, and validated manually by the author.

## AI Tool Usage Declaration

Initial Python scripts for the following tasks were drafted using ChatGPT (OpenAI 2025):
- Sentiment dictionary mapping and token-level analysis logic
- TF-IDF and z-score calculation across time periods
- Statistical test implementation (Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney U, Levene's Test)
- Data visualization code (boxplots, Q-Q plots, heatmaps)

**Important:** All generated code was:
- Thoroughly reviewed by the author for accuracy and appropriateness
- Modified to fit the specific research requirements
- Validated against expected outputs
- Tested with actual dissertation data

The author takes full responsibility for the final codebase and any errors therein.

## Acknowledgments


**Sentiment Dictionary:**
- **KNU Korean Sentiment Lexicon** (군산대학교 한국어 감성사전)
  - Source: [KnuSentiLex GitHub Repository](https://github.com/park1200656/KnuSentiLex)
  - The dictionary contains sentiment scores for Korean words and emoticons
  - Used for token-level sentiment analysis in this research
  - Some vocabulary and their scores added or edited by the author
     **Modifications by author:**
    - Additional domain-specific vocabulary added
    - Some polarity scores adjusted based on media context
    - Modified version used for token-level sentiment analysis in this research
  - Note: Modified lexicon is available in this repository as `dictionaries/SentiWord_Dict.txt`

## Main Analyses Included

- **Sentiment Scoring** using a custom Korean lexicon and KIWI tokenizer
- **TF-IDF Analysis**: Mean TF-IDF and z-score normalization across periods
- **Token-based analysis** (not word count) for more accurate ratio calculations
- **Media Type Classification**: 
  - Type 1 + 2 → Non-screen media
  - Type 3 → Screen media
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - Shapiro–Wilk (normality)
  - Levene's Test (homogeneity of variance)
  - Mann–Whitney U Test (used due to small N)
- **Visualization**:
  - Boxplots
  - Q-Q plots
  - Heatmaps (mean TF-IDF z-scores)
